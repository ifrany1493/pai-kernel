# Contributing to PAI-Kernel
## PAI Constitutional Document (PAI-CD)

Thank you for your interest in PAI-Kernel.

This is a normative standard — not a software project. Contributing here means engaging with governance architecture, not writing code. The bar for contribution is high by design: a weakened standard that is widely adopted is worse than a rigorous standard adopted narrowly.

## What we are looking for

### High-value contributions

**Specification gaps.** If you find a requirement in PAI-CD that cannot be implemented unambiguously by an independent team, that is a genuine finding. Open an Issue.

**Threat model gaps.** If you identify a manipulation or governance capture vector not addressed by the current threat model, describe it precisely: the attack, the mechanism, the failure mode, and why existing invariants do not close it.

**Invariant conflicts.** If two invariants produce contradictory requirements in a realistic deployment scenario, document the scenario and the conflict.

**Formal verification contributions.** If you can extend or verify the TLA+ specification, open a Pull Request with the model and the proof artifact.

**Reference implementations.** Independent implementations of PAI-CD that pass the Conformance Suite are the primary metric of the standard's success. We want to know about them.

### What we are not looking for

- Simplification of normative requirements for adoption convenience.
- Changes that weaken protections without closing a documented threat.
- Philosophical reformulations that do not change enforceable behavior.

## Amendment procedure

Changes to the normative corpus (PAI-CD documents) require a formal Amendment procedure:

1. **Open an Issue** describing the proposed change, the invariant it affects, and the direction (strengthening or clarification).
2. **14-day discussion period.** The community engages with the proposal.
3. **Invariant Impact Analysis.** The change must be assessed for protective direction — no amendment may weaken invariant protection without explicit justification.
4. **Ratification.** P0 ratifies after CAO non-weakening declaration.
5. **7-day pre-activation delay** before the change takes effect.

Amendments that strengthen protections have a lower procedural burden than amendments that weaken them. This asymmetry is intentional.

## How to open an Issue

Use the provided issue templates:

- **Amendment Proposal** — for proposed changes to normative documents
- **Specification Gap** — for ambiguities or implementation gaps

If your contribution does not fit either template, open a blank issue with a clear title describing the type of contribution.

---

## Style

- Write in the language of the document you are modifying (English for the normative corpus).
- Use MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / MAY for normative clauses. Avoid "should" as a casual hedge — use SHOULD only when you mean RFC 2119.
- Name the specific clause, principle, or invariant affected by your change.
- Describe failure modes explicitly.
